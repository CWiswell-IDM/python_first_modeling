1_lycanthrope: 
+ Werewolves
+ + Transmission only during full moon
+ + Outbreaks on Halloween
+ Queue for "turning"
+ + initializes to a hard-coded list of days
+ + FIFO push / pop
+ + BUGBUG: What happens if that list is zero? Don't know
+ + count_queue method to get "total waiting" for report
+ + demo.expose() pushes into queue in batches
+ + demo.expose() pops off of queue in batches, returns to caller
+ + caller has to remember to put new wolves into werewolf list or lose them
+ Artisnal age structure
+ + Gaussian parameters as method parameters
+ + Hand-forged age distribution

2_lycanthrope:
- Artisnal age structure
+ Age parameters written to demographic file
+ dtk_node_demog builds the population

2_lycanthrope_simpler:
- Age parameters
+ Supports other distributions 
+ + see demographics_uniform for a different example

3_lycanthrope:
- Queue for "turning"
- 'wolf_waiting_period' from werewolf_config
+ Incubation parameters from gi_SPOOKY.json
+- Make state of people the model's responsibility, not the caller's
+ Length of "waiting" now just a length, don't need a method call
